About the Eizauynga
====================
The Eizauynga was created during a course on 3D modeling with the use of the software known as Blender. 
It is a prototype space ship for what will eventually be known as the Hyperion. Being a prototype, it
does not have any proper yaw controls. It can also only fire straight and the cannons may be a bit hard 
to aim when in actual combat. The acceleration is limited so that the ship does not fly faster than its 
projectiles. 

Eizauynga Controls
====================

The left joystick controls the ship's acceleration and roll. 
The right joystick also controls the ship's roll but also controls the pitch as well.
Pressing anywhere on the screen outside of the joysticks with one finger will fire the laser guns. 
Pressing the screen with two fingers at the same time will change the firing mode of the guns.
The projectiles will stick to walls and the floor. To detonate these orbs, touch the screen with three fingers.

Eizauynga APKs
====================
Certain models which run Android will not be able to run this game and certain models will. Pick the correct 
APK based on the type and model of your Android device.
